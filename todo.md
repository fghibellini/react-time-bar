## TODO

- remove dependencies from bundle
- bundle some common functions used in demos and tests into a separate module
- clean up demos
- fiddle with eslint options

## Maybe

- memoize the timeStrToMinutes() calls
- throttle drags
- minimal mouse-coordinate change before drag
- enlarge handle to the outside when there is no interval on that side
- handle parallel mousedowns
