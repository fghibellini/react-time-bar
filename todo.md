## TODO

- handle touch creation of intervals
- bundle some common functions used in demos and tests into a separate module
- clean up demos
- fiddle with eslint options
- when no start/end change handlers are registered don't show the resize
  cursor when hovering over the side handles

## Maybe

- memoize the timeStrToMinutes() calls
- throttle drags
- minimal mouse-coordinate change before drag
- enlarge handle to the outside when there is no interval on that side
- handle parallel mousedowns
